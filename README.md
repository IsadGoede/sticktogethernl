# prj4-group-template

### A template for creating a group website

This one page example uses the following patterns:
- A navigation bar
- A hero section with two buttons and a gradient background
- A carousel with three images
- A grid with cards and placeholder images
- A footer
- Some CSS customization: navigation bar, hero section and body have their own background color
- Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway

Please check the comments in <index.html> and <css/styles.css>
